# New_York_City_Bikesharing
Module 15

# Overview:

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

  - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

  - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

  - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

# Results:

1) Our first visualization shows how long they take place. The peak duration for a trip is 5 minutes and a total of 146,752 riders.

3) This visualization is a heat map where showing the trips by weekday per hour the darker areas show more dense times and the max time and day is Thursday at 6 P.M.

4) This visualization is the same heat map as the prior heat map but it is separated by gender.

5) This visualization shows similar data to the prior heat map but is scaled down to be more dense but is still separated by gender. The max amount of rented bikes is on thursdays by men.

6) This visualization shows the peak hours for august bike rentals separated by time. It shows that the best time to get a bike rental is from 1 AM to 3 AM becuse that is the time with the least amount of bikes rented during the month.

7) This final visualization shows the average trip duration broken up by the birth year of the renter.

# Summary:

The analysis shows us some very important information about what demographics rent what bikes at what times this information could be very important to the CitiBike people so they can target how they advertise for their bike service.
